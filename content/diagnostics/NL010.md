### NL010 Keep code consistent
In Natural there are sometimes multiple names to the same thing that do not affect the result.

To keep the code style consistent prefer to do things the same way every time.

## Example

```natural
#VAR := *OCC(#ARRAY)
#VAR := *OCCURRENCE(#ARRAY)
```

These to lines have the same result.

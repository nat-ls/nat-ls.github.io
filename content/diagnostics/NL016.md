## Description
The variable that this `COMPRESS` is compressing into is used as a file path for a `DEFINE WORK FILE`.

The `COMPRESS` does not specify `LEAVING NO SPACE`, which can result in the file path containing spaces where
they are not expected (e.g. a leading space in the file name).

Add `LEAVING NO SPACE`.

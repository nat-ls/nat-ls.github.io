### A long literal containing lowercase was detected

Consider store long literals (usually used for text presented for output) in a file/table instead of being hardcoded.

This behavior can be configured using the ``natls.style.discourage_long_literals`` option in the [analyzer configuration](/docs/analyzer-config.md)

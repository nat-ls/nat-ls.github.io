### Code involving lowercase characters is discouraged

Code involving lower/mixed case characters is discouraged, because it involves special options to be enabled to work on the Mainframe.

This behavior can be configured using the `natls.style.discourage_lowercase_code` option in the [analyzer configuration](/docs/analyzer-config.md)

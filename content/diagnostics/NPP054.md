### NPP054: No source allowed after the END statement
The END statement indicates the end of the source of a Natural object.
No other statements or comment lines are allowed after the END
statement.

A probable cause of this error is the misspelling of a name or the
omission of 'PAGE', 'DATA', 'TRANSACTION' from the statements
AT END OF PAGE, AT END OF DATA, END TRANSACTION respectively.
